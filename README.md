# genetica
This is a tool for using a simplified genetics system to generate inheritable traits for DnD characters.

## DNA

Each generated character has a set of DNA with chromosomes. These chromosomes go to applying traits.

Inspiration: http://www.chromosomewalk.ch/en/list-of-chromosomes/

Common: 3> means if 3 is the highest rolled then the trait applies
Rare: 1-3 means that the roll for the father must be 1 and the mother must be 3
